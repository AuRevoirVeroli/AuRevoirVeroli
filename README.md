ğŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm @AuRevoirVeroli, and I'm thrilled to connect!
ğŸ‘€ I'm passionate about sports, especially football and tennis. I'm also a firm believer in economic liberalism.
ğŸŒ± Right now, I'm super pumped about learning Python, economics, and probability. I'm having a blast focusing on decision-making.
âš¡ I'm super excited to collaborate on AI trainers.
